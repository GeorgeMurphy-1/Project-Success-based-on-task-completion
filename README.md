# Project-Success-based-on-task-completion
# Task Completion Simulation

This repository contains a Python script for simulating task completion rates as a function of time. The primary goal is to investigate the impact of different task completion rate scenarios on the overall success of a project.

## Purpose

The intention behind this simulation is to understand the dynamics of completing tasks over time. The focus is on comparing the effects of starting with a high completion rate, transitioning to a medium level, and exploring variations in between, as opposed to starting with a low completion rate and gradually increasing it.

## Motivation

In real-world scenarios, the choice of a development/production strategy can significantly influence project outcomes. The hypothesis being explored is that initiating a project with a high task completion rate, especially in the early stages, may lead to a higher overall project success. This success is measured as the percentage of completed tasks relative to the total number of tasks.

## Simulation Model

The simulation is based on a stochastic differential equation that models the probability of task completion over time. The equation includes both deterministic and stochastic components to capture the dynamic nature of project tasks.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GeorgeMurphy-1/task-completion-simulation.git

 1. Navigate to the project directory: cd task-completion-simulation

 2. Run the Python script: python task_simulation.py
    
### Parameters
Adjust the parameters in the script, such as baseline completion rate, rate of change, and volatility, to explore different scenarios.

### Results
Examine the output and analyze how variations in task completion rates impact the overall success of the simulated project.
